# OptDisPro

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper **"OptDisPro: LLM-based Multi-agent Framework for Flexibly Adapting Heuristic Optimal DisFlow"**.

## Overview

This project aims to achieve automatic generation, solution, and execution of optimal power flow code for distribution networks through large language model (LLM) based multi-agent systems. The framework leverages multiple intelligent agents to collaboratively handle the complex task of power flow optimization in distribution systems.

## Current Status

**Note**: This paper is currently under submission. Therefore, only partial implementations are provided:

- Selected agent prompts (available in both Chinese and English versions)
- Generated code samples
- Partial test datasets

The complete codebase will be made available upon paper acceptance.

## Agent Prompts

The agent prompts are provided in two versions:
- **Chinese version**: Original prompts written in Chinese
- **English version**: Translated prompts in English

The original prompts were developed in Chinese and then translated to English for broader accessibility.

## Code Generation Examples

Below are three example objective functions generated by the framework for different optimization goals:

### 1. Maximize PV Generation
**optimization_example_pv.py**
This objective function aims to maximize the total power output from all PV systems in the network.
optimization_example_pv.py

### 2. Minimize Transformer Overload Rate
**optimization_example_trans.py**
This objective function calculates and minimizes the overload rate of all transformers in the network.
optimization_example_trans.py

### 3. Minimize the Node Voltage Deviation (V)
**optimization_example_volt.py**
This objective function calculates and minimizes the voltage deviation at all nodes in the network.

## Paper Abstract

OptDisPro proposes a novel multi-agent framework that utilizes large language models to flexibly adapt and generate heuristic optimal distribution flow solutions. The system employs multiple specialized agents working in coordination to automate the traditionally manual process of power flow optimization code development and execution.
